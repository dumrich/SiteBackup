* Pthreads Notes
- Threads allow you to partition work concurrently
- Have access to same address space
- Benefits of threading can be utilized mainly in a multiprocessor system, but even uniprocessor.o

This is helpful when a task is tagged with a ptid and we need to compare them to see which thread should be called.
