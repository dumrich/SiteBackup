      <description>Implementing Circular Queues in C In this article, I will be implementing a circular queue in C while explaining the theory of how it works.
Source Code
What is a Queue? A queue is a First In, First Out data structure. This means that items will be removed in the same order that they are added, hence first in, first out.
A frequent analogy that is used to describe queues is a line at some store.</description>

      <title>File I/O on Unix systems</title>

      <description>Unix systems have two ways of doing Input/Output (I/O) in C:
POSIX File I/O ISO C Standard I/O There are 2 different interfaces for I/O because the latter is meant to be portable. C implmentations must provide the &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; header, so it could work theoretically for any C implementation.
The POSIX implementation are unbuffered (more on that later), and usually invoke direct system calls to the kernel.
This post will go over both of types of I/O by implementing a very simple Swiper-like utility (for use in the Cemacs editor) in two different ways.</description>
