      <description>Building an Emacs Like Text Editor in C Repo Link
Over the past couple months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a text editor that aims to fix many of the hardships that I&amp;rsquo;ve faced as a GNU/Emacs user over the past few months. Specifically, I wanted to keep the core ideas of Emacs, but make some improvements, especially:
