I feel like Rocky was essentially Apollo after being trained by him, so prime Apollo could likely take Clubber.\nI felt that the movie could have been paced a little bit better. The first half was very slow, but the second half was really great. As many have pointed out, the whole Thunderlips scene added nothing to the movie, but I liked it nonetheless.\nNotable lines:\n“No, I don’t hate Balboa.

<p>This was a very solid addition to my favorite movie franchise ever. We see rivals become friends to overcome the new villain. This calls for some great lines, including my favorite in the movie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is no tomorrow! There is no tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During each of these films, I&rsquo;d always wondered why Rocky tolerated Paulie (Burt Young). Paulie was a loser who expected everything to be handed to him.</p>
<p>I also wondered how Apollo Creed would fare against Clubber Lang. I feel like Rocky was essentially Apollo after being trained by him, so prime Apollo could likely take Clubber.</p>
<p>I felt that the movie could have been paced a little bit better. The first half was very slow, but the second half was really great. As many have pointed out, the whole Thunderlips scene added nothing to the movie, but I liked it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Notable lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t hate Balboa. I pity the fool, and I will destroy any man who tries to take what I got!&rdquo;</p>
